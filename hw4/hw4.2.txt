Q1
Quantification is based on mapping the reads to the genomes using bbmap.
Do you think the mapping rate is good? what could be done to improve it?
  Mean mapping rate: 0.5748791655105142
  Altas map reads to contigs by bbmap written in `build_db_genomes` `align_reads_to_MAGs
  Maybe try BWA or Bowtie2 or HISAT2 for better performance (for short reads)
    

Q2
We use the median coverage over the genomes to calculate the relative abundance.
What is the most abundant species in these metagenomes?
  Just group the relative abundance by species.
  And the species with maximum abundance is
species      Akkermansia muciniphila
abundance                   0.155795
Name: 0, dtype: object
    

Q3
What are conserved functions among the genomes?
  I assume step_coverage higher -> more conserved
                                 module_name  step_coverage
module                                                     
M00178                    Ribosome, bacteria            1.0
M00179                     Ribosome, archaea            1.0
M00183              RNA polymerase, bacteria            1.0
M00260  DNA polymerase III complex, bacteria            1.0
    

Q4
Do you see trends (of conserved functions) by phylum?
  I assume conserved functions is the module that step_coverage > 0.8
  Then, I count the number of conserved functions group by phylum
phylum
Actinobacteriota     25.00
Bacteroidota         40.25
Deferribacterota     24.00
Desulfobacterota     41.00
Firmicutes           29.50
Firmicutes_A         31.75
Proteobacteria        9.00
Verrucomicrobiota    48.00
dtype: float64

Q5
Can you distinguish genomes from the Firmicutes_A and Firmicutes phyla?
  I run PCA on the step_coverage as MAG's features.
  See PCA result in hw4.2.png
  Most of Firmicutes can sepatated from Firmicutes_A, except MAG17.
